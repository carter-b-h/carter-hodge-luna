          <h2>About</h2>
              <p>Carter is an artist, educator and aspiring developer. They began teaching in 2020, having 
                    graduated in 2019. Carter decided to pursue this coding opportunity after feeling frustrated 
                    with the lack of functionality in apps they use regularly. As someone with ADHD, Carter acknowledges
                    how critical software can be in handling life tasks like scheduling, meal planning, personal finance etc.
                    Carter wanted to know how to code programs that would work with their particular brain, and naturally this got 
                    them to begin coding! Where this goes, we will see!
